🌀 The Loop
The Loop is a full-stack web application for collecting, organizing, and sharing thoughtful written content—whether it’s an opinion piece, a research reflection, a project log, or something that doesn’t quite fit the mold.

It’s designed for thinkers, tinkerers, and interdisciplinary minds who want to keep a public record of their evolving ideas, and for communities who value open-ended insight over hot takes.

✨ What It Does
🗂 Categorized post creation and display

🧠 Visual identifiers for different post types

👍🏽 Like / 👎🏽 Dislike feedback on posts

📚 Clean, minimal interface for reading and sharing ideas

Whether you're documenting a technical project, reflecting on a research problem, or sharing a bold opinion, The Loop gives you space to explore.

🛠 Technical Overview
Frontend: React, Bootstrap, React Router

Backend: Express.js with Sequelize ORM

Database: MySQL

API: RESTful endpoints for getting, posting, and retrieving content by ID

Deployment-Ready: Organized for full deployment with optional custom domain, S3, or EC2 hosting

The backend is structured around a Posts model with fields for title, content, author, category (as an ENUM), and user feedback (likes/dislikes). The frontend dynamically renders post cards, detailed views, and category-based icons using a responsive layout.
